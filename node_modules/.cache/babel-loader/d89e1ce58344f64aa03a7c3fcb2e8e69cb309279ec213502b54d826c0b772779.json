Breath Awareness</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Sit comfortably and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the\r\n        sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils or the\r\n        rise and fall of your abdomen. Simply observe the breath without trying\r\n        to control or change it. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to\r\n        the breath.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h3>2.

Mindful Eating</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Choose a small piece of food, such as a raisin or a slice of fruit.

Sound Awareness</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Sit in a quiet place and bring your attention to the sounds around you.\r\n        Notice the different tones, volumes, and qualities of the sounds. Resist\r\n        the urge to label or judge the sounds, simply observe them as they come\r\n        and go. Allow the sounds to anchor you to the present moment.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>6. Mindful Walking</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Engage in a mindful walking practice, whether indoors or outdoors.

Gratitude Practice</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Take a few moments to reflect on the things you are grateful for. Focus\r\n        on the small and simple joys in your life, expressing gratitude for\r\n        them. You can write them down in a gratitude journal or simply\r\n        contemplate them in your mind.

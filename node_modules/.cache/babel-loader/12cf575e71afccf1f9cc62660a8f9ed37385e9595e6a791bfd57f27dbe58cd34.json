For example, as you\r\n        release tension in your shoulders, you can repeat the affirmation \"I am\r\n        letting go of stress and embracing relaxation.\" Combine the physical\r\n        relaxation with affirmations to enhance the overall relaxation\r\n        experience.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>11.
